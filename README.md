# Secure-Bank-Application
Simple cryptographically secure bank application

The aim of the project was to create a ”Secure Bank Application” (SBA): a client-server application that allows users to issue operations on their own bank account. Where each user is modeled by a username and a password whereas each bank account by an accountID and a balance. For simplicity we assume that a user owns a single account and that an account is owned by a single owner.
